  center.

  suit your appâ€™s style.

  screen sizes.

      body: AnimatedCenterList(
        itemCount: 10,
        itemBuilder: (context, index, isCentered) {
          // isCentered is an extra parameter which will tell us that the widget is centered or not
          return Container(color: isCentered ? Colors.grey : Colors.transparent,
              child: Text('Item $index')
          );

      child: Container(
          color: isCentered ? Colors.blue : Colors.transparent,
          child: ListTile(
            title: Text('Item $index'),
